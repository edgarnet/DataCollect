==TUTORIAL==
To get started we will need a dataset to work with.
The sample dataset "collect.txt" is already provided,
in which you can simply >>enter:

>Please enter the filename of your dataset:
>>collect.txt

The data from your set should ONLY include real numbers.

The Mean, Median, Range, Variance, Standard Deviation, and
coefficient of variation of your dataset is then presented to the screen.

The option to calculate the Z-Score of a number is presented,
which will provide how many Standard Deviations away from the Mean 
your input is, as well as the ability to enter another number
or continue through the program.

To save the data report, simply >>enter a filename of your choosing:

>Enter the filename you would like to save this collection in:
>>myCollection.txt

A 'collection' stores the descriptive statistics of your dataset along with
the dataset preceded by their respective index. Collections are
not intended to be used as datasets, they are simply a means of saving the
analysis conducted by DataCollect.

Lastly, you are given the option to analyze another dataset or end the program.

Thank you for reading the DataCollect Version 2.01 manual!
